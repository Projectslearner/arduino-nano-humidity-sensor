# Humidity Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Humidity Sensor project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano with a DHT11 sensor to measure humidity and temperature. This project is valuable for applications requiring environmental monitoring, such as climate control systems and weather stations.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **DHT11 Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect DHT11 Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the data pin of the DHT11 sensor to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper grounding by connecting the sensor's ground pin to the Arduino Nano's ground (GND).
   - Connect the sensor's VCC pin to the Arduino Nano's 5V pin for power.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the DHT11 sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the correct board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the humidity and temperature values displayed in the serial monitor.

#### Applications

- **Climate Control Systems:** Use humidity sensors in HVAC systems for maintaining optimal indoor air quality.
- **Weather Stations:** Incorporate humidity sensors into weather monitoring systems for collecting environmental data.
- **Plant Monitoring:** Monitor humidity levels in agricultural settings to optimize plant growth conditions.

#### Notes

- Ensure the DHT11 sensor is adequately positioned to avoid interference with external factors affecting humidity readings.
- Calibrate the sensor if necessary for accurate humidity and temperature measurements.
- Implement error handling in the code to handle sensor communication failures or anomalies.
